            ★ From September to November 2020, I was a marketing assistant at
            Enedis, Tours. During my internship I had the opportunity to do
            competitive intelligence, however my main mission was to promote a
            SmartGrid demonstrator to the general public and local authorities.

            ★ From February to June 2021, during a company mission I was a
            member of a marketing research firm at E.Leclerc, Basse Goulaine.
            With my group I was able to create a questionnaire for a qualitative
            study, then I analysed the collected data to finally be able to
            propose recommendations to increase the results of the company.
